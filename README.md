This a simple console (command line) based program with a menu through which you can \loop". User
selects the menu option based on what they would like to do, program performs some action(s) and goes back
to displaying a menu.  
p1: design a model  
p2: create a schema and implement a database using DB2, populate your database with data, maintain, query and
update your data
